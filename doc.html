          Pours a clear, golden and rich brew, with a light tint of blush and topped with a creamy lacing. Soft aroma of raspberries, suggestions of something tart and a faint caramel on the nose. Quite smooth on the palate, firm, with a medium-body and moderate crispness. Malty base is just a tad sweet, with fresh pale malt and wheat flavors. A raspberry flavor rides in on off of the crispness and builds to a nice tart smack with salt and lime-like characters. Bitter, near puckering. The malts back things up just enough, too. Wheaty in the linger, which dries up nicely for a relatively clean finish.
